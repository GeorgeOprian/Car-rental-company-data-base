# Car-rental-company

This project tries to simulate a data base used by a car rental company which has multiples locations.

The data base has nine tables each one of them is normalised in in the Third Normal form.

You can see more details about how tables interact with eachother in "Conceptual schema.png"

This was a homework that I had to do for my Data Base course. The scope of this project was to desing, implement and excute some queries on this data base.
